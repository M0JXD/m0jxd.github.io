# {{ title }}

I love open source and am a passionate (but hopefully not insufferable) Linux user.
Some of my free time goes towards contributing/bugfixing open source projects I use and care about.
Here's a couple of my more notable contributions, but I have sent in smaller bugfixes/additions to a variety of projects now.

## Components for DIYLC

These were my first ever open source contributions. They're only simple components, but the Java 2D API was a good challenge for a budding developer.
I ended up adding a Voltage Source Symbol, Current Source Symbol (pictured), Bulb, Stingray Pickup, Buzzer Symbol and fixes/additions to the Resistor and Battery Symbols.

I even made some video tutorials in the end to help others get involved with contributing: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0dkfJJ4AgM&list=PLrKmpWTE8iQUW0RJYVDU6CNvc71-J55lI>

Alas, my time and willingness to contribute more to DIYLC has declined of recent. The core developer has now returned to working on DIYLC a bit more and has hopped aboard the AI hype train. I'm also put off working in Java again generally - Eclipse isn't great!

## Porting Textadept to Haiku

About a year ago, I ported the Textadept editor to Haiku. While it's not feature complete (there's some issues with the keybindings and generating the docs), it works pretty well! Hopefully as Haiku becomes more complete I can revisit this.

I've also sent in some fixes for Textadept, and made some modules too, e.g. [Discord Rich Presence integration](https://github.com/M0JXD/textadept-discord-rpc).
I also have a custom build to run on Windows 7 (just for funsies - please don't continue to use unsupported operating systems).

As a sidenote - Textadept is just awesome and I can't recommend it enough if you are developer looking for what is essentially a hyper scriptable notepad for programmers.
