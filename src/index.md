Hi, welcome to my website! It's a small place so I can share a bit about me and what I like to do. It's kind of somewhere between a portfolio and blog site, but more informal and intentionally less organised.

I've wanted my own page for some time, but I am not a web developer, so have developed this site with Eleventy with most of the content wrote in Markdown, using a small handful of HTML, CSS and Nunjucks that I've been able to cobble together thanks to the many learning resources about the internet. I chose to make the site this way in the spirit of my appreciation for fast, performant and minimalist software (but not to the extreme) that gets the job done well. Much of the site is still being wrote/constructed, and I am slowly learning some more about web technology so I can make it nicer.

The picture at the top is a very cute crotched version of a *certain popular blue hedgehog* that my sister made for me. I use it as a profile picture on most platforms.

## About me

To sum me up, I like:

- [Electronics](electronics) - Fixing things, making things... there's something very satisfying about soldering parts together and seeing them work!
- [Programming/Computers](programming) - My favoured programming languages are C, Lua, Python and more recently, Dart.
- [Guitars and Music](guitars-and-music) - My heroes are Nuno Bettencourt, Guthrie Govan, Fast Eddie Clarke, Jun Senoue, Neal Schon, Brett Garsed...
- Gaming - I mostly mean retro style here, I love the classic Mega-Drive and PS2 games, but am also very excited for GTA VI!
- Various other nerdy/geeky things - building Gundam models, Mathematics/Sciences, Rubik's cubes...

Oh, and food, and good TV 😊

## Here are some of the things I've done!

- [My Soldano Amplifier Clone Build](soldano)
- [Repairing Akta Bioscience Equipment](akta-repairs)
- [Making a loading utility for the Axe-FX II](axeii-loader)
- [Open Source Contributions](contributions)

## And some other ramblings...
