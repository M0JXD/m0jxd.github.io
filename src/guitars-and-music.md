# {{ title }}

I'm a keen guitarist, and have previously been in bands. For various reasons I have not been in a band for quite some time, but still share my playing on social media. I'm by no means popular or consistent, but I do find it fun.

Due to copyright, I won't share/upload the videos directly. However I can add embeds from the social platforms which bypasses this. I have picked a few of my favourites from over the years to add here (they are not necessarily my best performing videos). Most of the links are from YouTube, but a couple are TikTok embeds as YouTube's copyright is much stricter with regards to what I'm allowed to post. I apologise that TikTok embeds sadly attempt to autoplay and can not be aligned as I would like.

Thanks for requesting this one Lee (on Insta)! I&#39;ve spent ages trying to nail it!! (And tbh I&#39;m still not fully happy, it&#39;s bloomin hard!) Ofc the clouds came over right when the solo really starts kicking (which is kinda poetic) so sorry for jumpy exposure. Backing track from Rudess Backing Mc on YT, check out their channel. <a title="guitar" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/guitar?refer=embed">#guitar</a> <a title="guitarsolo" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/guitarsolo?refer=embed">#guitarsolo</a> <a title="sweetchildofmine" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/sweetchildofmine?refer=embed">#sweetchildofmine</a> <a title="slashgunsnroses" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/slashgunsnroses?refer=embed">#slashgunsnroses</a> <a title="gunsnroses" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gunsnroses?refer=embed">#gunsnroses</a> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Jamie Drinkell" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7544863329672596246?refer=embed">♬ original sound - Jamie Drinkell</a> </section> </blockquote> <script async src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"></script>
