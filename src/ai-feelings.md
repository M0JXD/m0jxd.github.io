title: My feelings on AI
---

# {{ title }}

I have many complicated feelings on AI that I'm hoping to articulate here. I'm not really done working through and articulating it yet so this page is an incoherent mess. I'm also aware many people do not care or want to see my opinions on this technology. Hence you'll only find it via the sitemap.

I think my internal turmoil stems from an a conflict of my geeky/nerd side being in amazement, saying "Holy crap! Computers can do this now?!" and my artistic side crying despair saying "Holy crap? Computers can do this now?!".

I appreciate the soul of things, with the hard work and talent required to make something truly beautiful. I really feel using AI takes away from that. As such I have made a point to use it infrequently.

I also don't agree with the sentiment of "you have to use it or you'll get left behind". The whole point is to be able to talk to it like you would another human. Look how annoyed everyone gets when a new release comes out and all the prompting techniques they've refined go down the trash. From my perspective, it's more important to get good at socialising and expressing your ideas *to other people*. As AI progresses, the ability to do that will naturally work when prompting the machines that are meant to understand you in this manner. Despite saying this thought, good communication one of my weaknesses - I am simply not a very social person!

AI has consistently made mistakes for me. I'm a mediocre developer and all things considered. While I did ask ChatGPT to help me with some of the weird oddities with the CSS on this site (the footer and aligning the sitemap link), it took a while before we got there and really required me to have a good enough understanding of what was happening to phrase it in a way that the bot would understand.

Example: Syntactically incorrect C code for the IUP GUI.
