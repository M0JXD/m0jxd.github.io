title: Morse Recognition Trainer App

# {{ title }}

I made this app for my Dad. He had said he wished there was an app like the one he used to have on an old Windows 10 tablet. Sadly it became a paid app, and as we had both switched to using Linux around the same time it would have been annoying to run through Wine anyways.

So I secretly got to work. I had wanted to play with Raylib for quite a while, and I finally got a chance to use it! Development was smooth and a week or so later I was able to show it to him. I'm very happy that this now works not only on Linux, but Windows, Android and the Web too! My Dad has found the app helpful (although his Morse proficiency is a bit more beyond what this app offers now).
