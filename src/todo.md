# {{ title }}

A quick TODO list for myself on this site:

- Finish articles, check spelling and grammar...
- Resize pictures again to consistent sizes and format.
- Fix header h1 title being a bit too big for mobile devices.
- Reduce text contrast etc. (ideas inspired from original/better/best/motherf*ckingwebsite...)
- A dark mode?
