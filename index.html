        <p>Hi, welcome to my website! It's a small place so I can share a bit about me and what I like to do. It's kind of somewhere between a portfolio and blog site, but more informal and intentionally less organised.</p>
<p>I've wanted my own page for some time, but I am not a web developer, so have developed this site with Eleventy with most of the content wrote in Markdown, using a small handful of HTML, CSS and Nunjucks that I've been able to cobble together thanks to the likes of W3Schools, Stack-overflow and YouTube. I chose an SSG in the spirit of my appreciation for fast, performant and minimalist software (but not to the extreme) that gets the job done well. Much of the site is still being wrote/constructed, and I am slowly learning some more about web tech so I can make it nicer.</p>
<p>The picture at the top is a very cute crotched version of a <em>certain popular blue hedgehog</em> that my sister made for me. I use it as a profile picture on most platforms.</p>
<p>Ahead of time, I want to apologise for the quality of the images on this site! Particularly with anything electronics, most of the pictures were taken to track how things came apart, and now I want to showcase these projects they're all I have 🫤.</p>
<h2>About me</h2>
<p>To sum me up, I like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="electronics">Electronics</a> - Fixing things, making things... there's something very satisfying about soldering parts together and seeing them work!</li>
<li><a href="guitars-and-music">Guitars and Music</a> - My heroes are Nuno Bettencourt, Guthrie Govan, Fast Eddie Clarke, Jun Senoue, Neal Schon, Brett Garsed...</li>
<li><a href="programming">Programming/Computers</a> - My favoured programming languages are C, Lua, Python and more recently, Dart.</li>
<li>Gaming - I mostly mean retro style here, I love the classic Mega-Drive and PS2 games, but am also very excited for GTA VI!</li>
<li>Understanding how things work (which is really an extension of the above points) - my favourite subjects at school were Mathematics and Physics, and I can solve Rubik's cubes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and food, and good TV 😊</p>
