        <h1>Work</h1>
<p>I wanted to add a bit about my employment and professional skills, but I'm going to be a bit reserved about actually stating any workplaces here. I love what I do and am immensely proud to be working for my company, but I am cautious that public opinions can have disastrous consequences. You can probably find me on LinkedIn anyway, but that little extra isolation never hurts. Plus many others at my current company do not have any public personas or even common social media accounts.</p>
<p>It should be noted any opinions on this site (or any that can be found about the internet) are my own and do not reflect those of the company I work for, any I have previously worked for, or might work for in the future. Regardless, I do hope there is nothing here that offends, peace and love to every one of you ♥️.</p>
<p>Over my career I have experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building/Developing Prototypes (I've joked that if they ever get me to do a PCB that I've began to think in Veroboard lines!)</li>
<li>Embedded development using FreeRTOS and Atmel SAM processors</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows Development with Visual Studio in C/C++</li>
<li>CAD Design</li>
<li>PCB Design Checking/Reviews</li>
<li>Python scripting</li>
<li>Some training/education on FPGA and VHDL</li>
</ul>
<p>In the spirit of honesty, I don't have a degree, but I do have qualification(s) relevant to the field. It's not that I never wanted to, it's just one of those things that hasn't happened (yet?).</p>
<p>Please reach out if you'd like a copy of my CV (which basically reiterates a lot of what is on this site but in a more succinct and professional manner).<br>
