        <h1>Open Source Contributions</h1>
<p>I love open source and am a passionate (but hopefully not insufferable) Linux user.
Some of my free time goes towards contributing/bug-fixing open source projects I use and care about.
Here's a couple of my more notable contributions, but I have sent in smaller bugfixes/additions to a variety of projects now.</p>
<h2>Components for DIYLC</h2>
<p>These were my first ever open source contributions. They're only simple components, but the Java 2D API was a good challenge for a budding developer.
I ended up adding a Voltage Source Symbol, Current Source Symbol (pictured), Bulb, Stingray Pickup, Buzzer Symbol and fixes/additions to the Resistor and Battery Symbols.</p>

<p>I even made some video tutorials in the end to help others get involved with contributing: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0dkfJJ4AgM&amp;list=PLrKmpWTE8iQUW0RJYVDU6CNvc71-J55lI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0dkfJJ4AgM&amp;list=PLrKmpWTE8iQUW0RJYVDU6CNvc71-J55lI</a></p>
<p>Alas, my time and willingness to contribute more to DIYLC has declined of recent. The core developer has now returned to working on DIYLC a bit more and has hopped aboard the AI hype train. I'm also put off working in Java again generally - Eclipse isn't great!</p>
<h2>Porting Textadept to Haiku</h2>
<p>About a year ago, I ported the Textadept editor to Haiku. While it's not feature complete (there's some issues with the key-bindings and generating the docs), it works pretty well! Hopefully as Haiku becomes more complete I can revisit this.</p>

<p>I've also sent in some fixes for Textadept, and made some modules too, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/M0JXD/textadept-discord-rpc">Discord Rich Presence integration</a>.
I also have a <a href="https://github.com/M0JXD/textadept/releases/tag/13-alpha-win7">custom build to run on Windows 7</a> (just for funsies - please don't continue to use unsupported operating systems).</p>
<p>As a side-note - Textadept is just awesome and I can't recommend it enough if you are developer looking for what is essentially a hyper scriptable notepad for programmers.</p>
