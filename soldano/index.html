        <h1>Soldano Amplifier Clone Build</h1>
<p>I first knew I wanted a SLO-100 when I found out one of my guitar idols, Jun Senoue (you did see the bit on Retro gaming right?) was a prominent user. Well it turns out they're kinda pricey, so I built one! Turns out there's a great community of builders too, even with their own forum. Of course many of my other heroes have used them too - Nuno, EVH... and anyone who uses a Mesa Rectifier or Peavey 5150 is using a derived circuit with that oh so important 39k cathode resistor. However it's FAR too loud so I don't play it as much as I'd like too, but it is a wicked monster of an amp.</p>

<p>I took various photo's throughout the build, but to start I had to get the parts. I got the base kit from <a href="https://guitar-electronics.eu/">https://guitar-electronics.eu/</a>, and ordered the other parts from Mouser, eBay, and the occasional other supplier. The transformers are by InMadOut, a popular choice among builders.</p>
<p>Sadly, I didn't think to take any pictures when populating the PCBs, which I had done before the transformers or chassis even arrived. Here's my first picture of everything together ahead of building it.</p>

<p>First up was fitting the valve bases.</p>

<p>Then doing the heater wiring.</p>

<p>Adding the screen grid stoppers, and wiring the mains transformer.</p>

<p>Adding the choke and wiring in the PSU board.</p>

<p>Finally adding the main board and wiring it up.</p>

<p>After all that work, the SLOClone was done! I was very lucky that at the first power-up, I biased it and the amp just worked. I was actually somewhat disappointed I wasn't going to need to fault find the amp! That first strum was killer though - me and my dad had earache for weeks!</p>
<p>Here are some more completed pictures.</p>

<p>A long time later, I finally got around to fitting it into a Cabinet. This is a re-used Cabinet from another trashed amplifier.</p>
